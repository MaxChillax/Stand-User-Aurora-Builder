		<description>
			<p> A man stands, tall and proud. Before him, a monster of unimaginable power, whose evil nature is concealed by his beautiful appearance. The man takes a deep breath, and silence fills the air. Then, there is a shout. "Rise Against!" Before the minute is up, the vampire falls, and the man mutters in his annoyance with the mess.</p>
			<p class="indent">A child runs through the busy streets of Waterdeep, knocking over pedestrians in his haste. From the perspective of all others, there is nothing behind him. But the child knows, the child sees. A hound with four heads, each flaming and golden, chases after him. The beast's mater is nowhere nearby, and the child knows he must figure out who the user is before it's too late. The child screams "Getaway!", and a giant like creature appears, carrying the child on its shoulder.</p>
			<p class="indent">A woman walks into the bank. Everyone's eyes turn to her, yet they don't know why. No one can turn their head away from the woman, whose smirk and laugh almost distracts from the noise behind everyone. Three figures, each with masks, walk out of the vault, and the woman dashes away with them, shouting "Dramaturgy!"</p>
			<p class="indent">As different as these people are, they share a single common trait. They are Stand Users, those who draw upon the power of their spirit to summon Stands, physical manifestations of their psyche.</p>
			<h4>DIVERSE ORIGIN</h4>
			<p>Anyone can be a Stand User, provided they have the mental fortitude to summon their psyche. A Stand can first manifest any number of ways, and not even all are properly known. Certain items can draw out the spiritual energy and give those that come into contact access to their Stand. Some awaken to their power when they need it most, in a moment of high tension. Some are simply born with their Stand and have almost always had them by their side. And, rarely enough, an entire lineage of Stand Users can develop, the bonds of fate and blood carrying the spiritual energy throughout the entire line.</p>
			<h4>SINNERS, SAINTS, AND WERIDOS</h4>
			<p>One can say with almost scientific certainty that a Stand User must have a strong force of will. Along with that, with as much certainty, one can say that Stand Users' have a tendency to be an odd bunch. In their ranks stands the greatest of heroes, and most monstrous of villains, and the most eccentric souls one could ever meet. Because of this, outsiders have a mixed opinion of Stand Users.</p>
			<p class="indent">One could slaughter your family, another come and defeat the first, and a third coming only to play rock-paper-scissors with the second. Though most aren't aware of Stands at all, save for a rare few, those that do tend to be initially distrustful of Stand Users.</p>
			<h4>BOUND TO FATE</h4>
			<p>Fate is often an important concept for many Stand Users. Some believe that fate guides them on their proper path, while others try to avoid or overthrow it. Some even still will seek the power to manipulate fate to their advantage. Fate is also believed to be the reason why Stand Users meet.</p>
			<p class="indent">Like gravity, destiny pulls Stand Users towards each other, seemingly for no rhyme nor reason. If a village has even a single Stand User in it, it will inevitably have two. Then three, then four, and so on. Stand Users will either befriend or clash with each other, with very little in between.</p>
			<h4>STAND NAMES</h4>
			<p>Each Stand has a unique name, given to it by its User. Stand Users have various naming conventions for how to title their Stand. Some choose the names of gods, others cards, and many, many more.</p>
			<p class="indent">The most common, however, is to name a Stand after a song or band of bards. Few know how this became the most common, but the general theory involves a vampire Stand User with the Stand named "Prince".</p>
			<h4>CREATING A STAND USER</h4>
			<p>There are several things to consider when making a Stand User. How did your Stand awake? Did an item pull the power out of you? Were you sick for a time as a child, then noticed the Stand manifesting? Also, consider the other Stand Users you've met. Are they friendly? Dangerous? Perhaps you start your adventure trying to hunt down a particularly troublesome User whom you have a grudge against. Then there is the name and appearance of your Stand itself. Does the name correlate to its powers, or is it simply ornamental? Is it humanoid, or some kind of beast? Does it even have a proper physical form?</p>
			<p class="indent">Work with your DM to determine these things, as well as the general role and knowledge of Stand Users in your game.</p>
			<h3>CLASS FEATURES</h3>
			<p>As a Stand User, you gain the following class features.</p>

			<p>At 1st level, you learn to call out your psyche as a Stand! When you roll for initiative or as a bonus action, you can send out your Stand. It has the following traits:</p>
			<p>*Your Stand stays within a certain range of you, determined by its type. It is incorporeal, able to pass through solid objects, but can interact with the world. Your Stand can move anywhere within its range on your turn.</p>
			<p>*When summoned, your Stand can have a duplicate of one of your weapons, or some manifestation analogous to one (ex. horns, launcher, fists, etc). You can take actions and make attacks through your Stand, and attack performed through your Stand deal force damage, using your Stand attack modifier (see below). You also add your charisma modifier to the damage, rather than your strength or dexterity. Actions your Stand takes that require an ability, such as a grapple or shove check, use your charisma rather than the original ability.</p>
			<p>*Your Stand cannot be hit by normal attacks or spells, and can only be damaged by other Stands. Damage dealt to the Stand gets mirrored onto you (ex. your Stand loses a hand, you lose one of yours).</p>
			<p>*Your Stand can only be seen by you, other Stand Users, and creatures with Truesight or other magical detection abilities.</p>
			<p>*Unless otherwise stated, you can see and speak using your Stand. You can dismiss your Stand as a free action, and it will disappear if you are reduced to 0 hit points.</p>
